			<p>This system's language (ProLin) was designed to be as close as possible to the mathematical notation of writing Linear Programming models. It's easy to use. Click on the <i>Generate Example</i> button to show random examples on how to write input programs with additional tips on the language.</p>
			<p>This system was developed to support students' learning, as well as teaching; however, anyone can use it. It's still under development and improvement.</p>
			<p>To those who are interested in learning more widespread languages with more describing power, with the objective of efficiently solving large and complex programs, the author suggests the study of GMPL (GNU Mathematical Programming Language, also known as GNU MathProg Language). It's part of GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit), found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">in this page</a>.</p>
			<p>The system's solving module was developed using the GLPK API for the programming language C, version 4.45.</p>
